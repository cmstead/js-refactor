# JS Refactor -- DEPRECATED/UNSUPPORTED #

### The TL;DR ###

JS Refactor is closing its doors, BUT there is a new extension coming.

Here's the github link: https://github.com/cmstead/js-codeformer

The marketplace link will be forthcoming.

### The Long Version ###

JS Refactor had a good run -- about 6 years. It was the first extension I ever built for VS Code, and I learned a lot from it. Unfortunately, there were a number of design choices I made (and didn't make) which lead to the most common of software problems: slowing of development until no development was happening at all.

The code had become a disaster, the bugs mounted, and people were unhappy. I can't blame them. At this point, the software only really works some of the time anyway.

### Now What? ###

The question I asked when I created JSR was "can I build a refactoring plugin for VS Code?" The answer was a resounding "yes, but". That "but" was really the heart of the problem. The VS Code extension API was still in development, and underwent a number of changes. This means the software had to account for the unstable environment.

This is not an indictment of the folks who were working hard on the API, it's just the state of the world at the time.

SO...

The extension API has stabilized, and I have learned a lot. I have a new question now: "what would I do to create a smoother experience for developers working with JS and JS-adjacent technology?"

I have some answers now, and some are sure to emerge:

1. Carry forward some important core features from JSR, and make them stable
2. Think about developer experience, usability, and accessibility first
3. Support developers and make their code-authoring experience awesome

So, in the end, this isn't goodbye. It's not the death of a tool, it's the birth of something better.

I hope you'll join me and we can make awesome software together!

## Automated Refactorings

**Basic usage:** Make a selection, right click and select the refactoring you want to perform from the context menu.

**Command Pallette:** You can press F1 then simply type the name of the refactoring and press enter 
if you know the name of the refactoring you need.

**Shortcuts:** Finally, there are hotkey combinations for some of the most common refactorings you might want. Hotkeys are listed in the keybindings section below.

JS Refactor supports the following refactorings (explanations below):

**Common Refactorings:**
- Extract Method
- Extract Variable
- Inline Variable
- Rename Variable (Alias of VS Code internal command)

**Other Utilities:**
- Convert To Arrow Function
- Convert To Function Declaration
- Convert To Function Expression
- Convert To Template Literal
- Export Function
- Introduce Function
- Lift and Name Function Expression
- Negate Expression
- Shift Parameters
- Wrap selection options:
    - Arrow Function
    - Async Function
    - Condition
    - Function
    - Generator
    - IIFE
    - Try/Catch

    - Mac: cmd+shift+j v

    - Mac: cmd+shift+j p
- Wrap selection
    - Windows/Linux: ctrl+shift+j w
    - Mac: cmd+shift+j w

### Usage

Select the code you wish to refactor and then press the F1 key to open the command pallette.  Begin typing the name of
the refactoring and select the correct refactoring from the list. You will be prompted for any necessary information.

### Explanations

#### Core Refactorings ####

**Extract Method** Creates new function with original selection as the body.

**Extract Variable** Creates new assigned variable declaration and replaces original selection.

**Inline Variable** Replaces all references to variable with variable initialization expression, deletes variable declaration.

#### Other Utilities ####

**Convert To Arrow Function** Converts a function expression to an arrow function.

**Convert To Function Declaration** Converts a function expression, assigned to a variable, to a function declaration.

**Convert To Function Expression** Converts an arrow function to a function expression.

**Convert To Template Literal** Converts a string concatenation expression to a template literal.

**Export Function** creates new export declaration for selected function or function name

**Introduce Function** creates new function from existing function call or variable assignment

**Lift and Name Function Expression** Lifts function expression from current context, replacing it with provided name and adds name to expression

**Shift Parameters** Shifts function parameters to the left or right by the selected number of places

**Wrap In Condition** Wraps selected code in an if statement, adding indentation as necessary

**Wrap in function** takes your selected code, at line-level precision, and wraps all of the lines in a named function.

**Wrap in IIFE** wraps selected code in an immediately invoked function expression (IIFE).

## Snippets

JS Refactor supports several common code snippets:

- Anonymous Function (anon)
- Arrow Function (arrow)
- Async Function (async)
- Class
    - Definition (class)
    - Constructor (ctor)
    - Method (method)
- Condition Block (cond)
- Console Log (log)
- Export statement -- single variable (export)
- Export statement -- object literal (exportObj)
- Function (fn)
- Generator (generator)
- Lambda function (lfn)
- Immediately Invoked Function Expression (iife)
- Member Function (mfn)
- Prototypal Object Definition (proto)
- Require statement (require)
- Try/Catch Block (tryCatch)
- Use Strict (strict)

### Usage

Type the abbreviation, such as fn, in your code and hit enter. When the snippet is executed, the appropriate code will be
inserted into your document. Any snippets which require extra information like names or arguments will have named
tab-stops where you can fill in the information unique to your program.

### Explanations

**anon** Inserts a tab-stopped anonymous function snippet into your code

**export** Adds a module.exports single var assignment in your module

**exportObj** Adds a module.exports assignment with an object literal

**fn** Inserts a tab-stopped named function snippet into your code

**lfn** Inserts a tab-stopped lambda function snippet into your code

**iife** Inserts a new, tab-stopped IIFE into your code

**mfn** Inserts a new color-delimited member function to your prototype -- Protip be inside a prototype object when using this.

**require** Inserts a new require statement in your module

**strict** Inserts 'use strict' into your code

### Contribution Rules and Guidelines

JS Refactor is open to pull requests for everything from code to documentation.  As with any project, there are certain
needs which must be addressed.  JS Refactor is, at its core, still in development. Since it was built on an early version
of Visual Studio Code, so there is a fair amount of code that was originally exploratory in nature. In its current state, 
JS Refactor is fully tested and behaviors are vice-tested into place.  Going forward, code will be cleaned and, itself,
refactored, so a style guide is going to be relatively fluid.

Nevertheless, following are the required elements of a good pull request:

- **Code updates must be covered by a test.**
- **Code must follow existing standards as they are available.**
- **All existing behaviors must continue to function as designed.**
- **All tests must continue to pass. Any pull requests with failing tests cannot be accepted.**
- **Pull request must explain changes which are made, referring to an issue number as available.**
- **Pull requests may not be claimed as intellectual property of a company or other external agency.**
